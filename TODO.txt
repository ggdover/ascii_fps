Stuff that cand be improved/added moving forward

* Add so SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT can be set by sending
  as arguments when executing binary.
  Would be really cool if user could do something like:
  './ascii_fps | stty size' or './ascii_fps < stty size'
  to have it set SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT to what will create
  a perfect fit for the current size (width/height) and font/character
  size on the terminal.
  - Also update the README.md with this information so people who wants
    to run it and try are aware of this.

* Add some information on how to build and run it yourself
  - Also include information that the rendering will looked
    messed up if terminal window is not big enough to hold
    the size that is set on constants SCREEN_WIDTH and SCREEN_HEIGHT
    in the application.

* Fix so terminal colors is always restored after exiting.

* Improve the input handling so we don't have any delay before
  repeat output starts.
  - You notice this when you press and hold a key, the first
    character will come immediatley, but then there is a short
    delay before the same character is repeated as long as the
    key is held down.
    This is disruptive compared to the responsive input handling
    that one would expect when you are trying to move a character
    in a fps game.
